## Getting Set Up

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bin/setup`

## Running the application

Run `rails server`

## Contributing to the Application

Pushes to master are disabled by default in order to prevent Git conflicts. To contribute, create a branch with your changes and when they are ready to be merged, open a pull request for the team to review. This allows the team to understand what's going on throughout the app, provide feedback to other team members, and learn. [Read here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to learn about creating a pull request.

## Running the application on the web with Heroku

Heroku provides the ability to host a hobby Rails application for free for demo purposes. It also makes it very easy to push up your Rails application quickly and easily. To get started with Heroku, follow along with their [getting started guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5).
